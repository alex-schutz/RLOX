# Reinforcement Learning Noughts and Crosses

Play Noughts and Crosses against a computer!

Run `play.py` and choose a difficulty level. 
If you haven't played before, the algorithm will train itself to play and save its learning.
When it's ready, input the position you want to play in the 3x3 grid, until you win, lose or tie.
Have fun!
